# SpeakerProfiling
Our team sought to determine the best method to profile specific characteristics of a speaker, given an audio sample. We pre-processed the data to create an even distribution across labels, normalized, and computed fourier transformations as well as F0 fundamental frequency. We then tested different models to determine the most effective classifier.
